###IoT

# Main Purpose
To use dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance cybersecurity in home networks by identifying vulnerabilities, detecting attacks, tracing attack sources, assessing impacts, and developing protection and recovery strategies.

# Expected Outcomes
Enhanced Vulnerability Detection: A model that flags vulnerable devices in real-time.

Accurate Source Tracing: Tools for tracing the origin of attacks quickly.

Comprehensive Impact Assessment: A framework to measure attack impact on network performance.

Improved Attack Detection and Prediction: A robust system for identifying and predicting attacks.

Effective Protection and Recovery: Strategies to isolate compromised nodes and ensure rapid recovery.
