### Problem Statement(Phishing Email):

Traditional machine learning (ML) methods for identifying phishing emails often rely heavily on manual feature engineering and source code features. These methods struggle to detect new phishing scams effectively and are slow due to their dependence on third-party services and content scraping. This results in significant delays and reduced accuracy in phishing email classification, making it difficult to keep up with the rapidly evolving phishing techniques.

### Research Question: 
How can the integration of AI and quantum computing enhance the speed and accuracy of phishing email detection by automating feature engineering and reducing dependency on third-party services, compared to traditional ML methods?

These methods primarily focus on limited features like URL properties and specific email characteristics, which can be easily obfuscated by attackers.

### Expanding: 
Go beyond URL properties and include a wider range of features such as email headers, sender behavior, email content analysis. Utilize features from the email body, attachments, and links. OR use Quantum computing to create unknown realistic threats.

Leverage quantum computing to improve the efficiency and speed of data processing, enabling real-time phishing detection.

Utilize quantum algorithms for feature selection and model training to handle high-dimensional data more effectively.

### Problem Statement(Facial Pattern Recognition):
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2021/5196000 
Facial expression recognition systems, while effective, often face limitations in accuracy, computational cost, and time consumption due to the complexity of image data and the limited number of samples per class in datasets like FER2013. Integrating quantum computing with deep learning techniques can potentially address these challenges by enhancing data processing capabilities, improving pattern recognition, and reducing computational overhead.

The model on this paper attained an accuracy of 0.70 which is very close to the state-of-the-art model that already exists.

### Research Question:

*How can the integration of quantum computing with deep learning improve the accuracy and enhance the efficiency of facial expression recognition systems, compared to traditional methods?*

### Expanding:

Expanding on this research, address the issue of limited samples per class which can be done by increasing the number of samples per class using quantum computing.

1. Synthetic Data Generation: Use quantum generative models to create new, realistic images for each class. These models can generate high-quality samples that mimic the properties of the original data.
    1. Use Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) to generate synthetic images for classes with fewer samples.
2. Data Augmentation: Apply quantum-enhanced data augmentation techniques to existing images to create new variations. This can include operations such as rotation, translation, and scaling, which are done in a quantum-enhanced manner to increase the variety of the data.
    1. Apply quantum data augmentation techniques to the existing images. 

Machine Learning can be used to automate this data augmentation which will increase overall accuracy.
